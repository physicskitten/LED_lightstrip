arduino code for calibrating an LED strip with alternating pattern used as an additional visual aid for an experiment.
The next step could be to change the code to accomodate for more than 2 colour patterns. 
More than 2 colours are not necessary for this experiment, however could prove to be a useful tool in future projects.
